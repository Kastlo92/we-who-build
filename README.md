**We Who Build**

We Who Build is a city builder focused on managing districts and the people living in them.
The population will react to the city you choose to make. Their happiness and their future is in your hand!

Made entirely in Godot using GDScript.

TODO:

- [x] Put grass terrain on all tile at the start of the game

- [ ] buttons logic:

 -[x] by right clicking the house will not be "Positionable"
 -[ ] when we're placing the tiles we should get a "preview" of the selected building in a more transparent color.
		--> While a building is selected we could draw on the tilemap where the mouse is moving (ideally only the sprite)
		--> We can adjust the transparecy of the object while we're setting it.
		--> we could also get a duplicate of every tile in its pre-positioned phase (more transparent) and use that, but that
		--> would require having a duplicate of my atlas with another set of coordinates etc...
- [ ] mettere Un pulsante per selezionare l'edificio da mettere nella Grid
